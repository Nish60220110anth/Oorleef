# Oorleef

## Description
Oorleef is a single player third person survival game. The Main character in the game lives in a post apocalyptic world and his is aim is to survive the harsh conditions of the Earth and ultimately escape the planet as it becomes too unfit to support any form of life.

## Problem  Statement
In today’s world, people tend to overestimate the availability of edible food due to the ease of access with which they get it. People are unaware of the work that goes behind the production of edible food and the effort a large group of people put to produce a plate of food in front of us.
 Children these days are also unaware of the consequences of wasting edible food and water. Also overwhelmingly raising population every year demands for more food to be generated. Consequently soon the land areas would also be used up and there would be an unavailability of cultivable land sources. 
These issues would once again teach humans the importance of clean food and water.

We have primarily focused on emphasizing the SDG Goals  
1. Zero Hunger (2)
2. Good Health and Well being (3)
3. Climate action (13)
4. Life on land (15)

## Why it is important ?

It is important that the participants of the game realize and understand the consequences of our present actions.
The problem statement talks about food wastage. In 2021 , 69 million metric tonnes of food was wasted in India alone and major contribution of food waste is from household’s.
To put the same into different perspective, it is equivalent to the weight of 17,500,000 elephants.
To make the player know the type of food intake for accordingly for health.
We, as the game developers intent to plant the seed of thought and hope into the minds of the youth who are expected to play and interact with our game. It is important to make them aware of the direct and indirect consequences that they might have to face in the future and the possibilities of changes that they could adapt.
The post apocalyptic world also helps the user understand the significance of the quality of life on land we are currently experiencing.
The sooner the audience realize the need for the SDGs and the goals behind the plenty of games being created today, the better chances they have to reform and bring about a positive change in the World.

## How your going to resolve it ?

Application based solutions including games, although cannot directly solve the challenges mentioned by the SDGs taken up, we expect that our solution would rather focus on affecting the minds of the youth and planting a seed of thought concerning the significance of food and water for basic survival of a human being.
Our game is expected to help the targeted audience better understand and reflect on the luxuries we are exposed to. It is also expected to make the participants realize the commodities we take for granted once they are taken out of the equation!
